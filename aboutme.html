  <!-- DAD: CHANGE ABOUT ME BIO HERE -->
  <p class="para">I'm a woodworker, bass player, and real estate agent based in The Gorge.</p>
  <p class="para">I guess I started doing woodwork with my dad, and have been at it one way or another since then. For a while after Vietnam I was actually a licensed contractor in California for cabinet and millwork. Artistically, however, it has just been the last 20-25 years. Dressers, tables, cabinets, and such, and for the last 15 years my focus has been making bowls on the lathe. I begin with fresh wood that gets cut down right here in the Gorge.
